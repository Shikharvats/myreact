My react projects
This project is about a Resturant site where you will see menu option and where you can search menu based on different options like Breakfast , lunch and evening snacks and Dinner and you can view all items at once.
This is created on component based approach where different components are created to prevent repitition of code.
Used some part of hooks also for state management.
In this project I have created my own API for data which has all menu options listed.
